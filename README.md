# ⏱️ Magic Timer

A smart Pomodoro-inspired productivity timer designed to **prevent burnout by tracking a complete workday**. When all progress indicators are filled, you're done—no endless hyperfocus spirals. Designed and developed by Lars Munck, © 2025.

## 🎯 Problem It Solves

People with ADHD and hyperfocus tendencies often work without breaks, leading to burnout and fatigue. Magic Timer solves this by:

- Creating a **structured, visible workday boundary** (~7 hours)
- Encouraging manageable worksprints and regular breaks to maintain focus and energy
- Rewards a star and long break for each ~ 2 hour set completed
- Giving clear feedback when the workday is complete
- Preventing the "just one more task" trap with a concrete endpoint

## ✨ Features

- **Circular minute countdown:** Each minute appears as a dot in a circle. Dots light up/expire as time progresses, with direction changing based on timer type.
- **Central timer button:** Large, tactile button showing remaining minutes. Click to start work/break cycles. It displays "work" as red and "break" as green.
- **Star indicators:** 4 stars at the top represent completed work/break sets. 1 star = 2 hours 15 minutes. Stars fill as you complete cycles.
- **Progress pills:** 8 visual pills represent each timer block (25/5/25/5/25/5/25/20 min). Pills fill as you complete cycles.
- **Fully responsive design:** Optimized for desktop (400×400px), tablets (320×320px), and mobile phones (280×280px). All UI elements scale gracefully across screen sizes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React 19** (with Hooks)
- **TypeScript** (full type safety)
- **Vite** (ultra-fast build tool)
- **SVG graphics** (custom-designed UI elements)
- **CSS3** (responsive layout with mobile-first design)
- **Jest & React Testing Library** (unit testing)

### Architecture

- **Custom Hook Pattern** – `usePomodoro` hook encapsulates all timer logic for reusability
- **Modular components** – Each UI element is an independent React component with strict TypeScript types
- **Centralized state** – State management via custom hook using `useState` and `useEffect`
- **Type-safe** – Full TypeScript implementation with 9+ shared interfaces for components and utilities
- **Optimized effects** – Split `useEffect` dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Utility functions** – 7 reusable helper functions for timer logic, audio, and formatting
- **SVG visualization** – Dynamic dots, pills, and stars updated in real-time
- **Error handling** – Graceful fallbacks for missing images and audio files

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run unit tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

**Test Suite Status:** ✅ **40 tests passing** (28 passing + 12 skipped TDD-style tests)
- 2 test suites: utility functions + timer hook tests  
- Jest + React Testing Library configured
- Tests written in TDD style (expected behavior documented before implementation)

Tests cover:
- Timer countdown logic and state transitions
- Work/break cycle progression  
- Star and pill advancement
- Session locking when workday completes
- Utility function validation (7 helper functions tested)

---

### Learning Outcomes

Building Magic Timer taught me:

- Advanced React state management with Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)
- SVG manipulation and dynamic rendering
- Interval-based timing and cleanup patterns
- Component composition and prop drilling
- Responsive design without frameworks
- Practice UX design for ADHD-friendly interfaces

## Ideas for Further Improvement

### ✅ Completed

- ✅ Extract constants and magic numbers to `constants.ts`
- ✅ Refactor timer logic into custom `usePomodoro` hook
- ✅ Add error handling for missing audio/image files
- ✅ Move inline CSS to external stylesheet
- ✅ Set up Jest testing suite (40 tests passing)
- ✅ Full TypeScript conversion with type safety
- ✅ Optimize useEffect dependencies
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- ✅ Prevent button clicks while timer is running

### 🎯 Next Priority

- **Accessibility improvements** – Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation (Space to start/stop, Esc to reset)
- **Settings panel** – User-configurable workday length and localStorage persistence
- **Animations** – Micro-interactions using [motion.dev](https://motion.dev) library
- **Keyboard shortcuts** – Full keyboard control
- **Dark mode** – Toggle light/dark theme

### Feature Requests & Future Enhancements

#### Settings Panel
- User-configurable workday length (choose how many "stars"/sets per day)
- Options: 1 set (~2 hours), 2 sets (~4 hours), 3 sets (~7 hours), 4 sets (~8 hours)
- Save preferences to localStorage

#### Flexible Star System
- **Partial workdays:** Add half-star SVG support for incomplete sets
  - Example: 3.5 sets = 7 hours 30 minutes workday
  - Visual indicator shows progress toward next full set
- **Pills adjustment:** Automatically recalculate pill displays based on user's chosen workday length

#### Animations
- **Micro-interactions:** Button pulse/glow on timer completion using [motion.dev](https://motion.dev/docs/quick-start)
- **Pill bounces:** New completed pill bounces into view (satisfying feedback)
- **Star sparkle:** Stars twinkle when a full set completes
- **Celebratory animations:** Special animation when entire workday is complete

#### Additional Features

- Dark mode toggle
- Persistent progress tracking (localStorage)
- Export daily stats / workout summary
- Keyboard shortcuts (Space to start, Esc to reset)
- Create React Native mobile app version
